## API Versioning

The Flare API uses URL versioning. The current version is `v1`.

```
https://api.flameup.ai/api/v1/...
```

When we release breaking changes, we'll introduce a new API version (e.g., `v2`) while maintaining support for previous versions during a deprecation period.

**Version Support Policy:**
- New versions are announced at least 6 months before deprecation of old versions
- Deprecated versions continue to work for at least 12 months after announcement
- Security fixes are backported to supported versions
