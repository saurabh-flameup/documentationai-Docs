## Core Concepts

Understanding the fundamental principles of Flame It Up is essential for maximizing its potential. The platform revolves around three key concepts: ignition points, flame propagation, and heat management.

Ignition points serve as the starting sparks that initiate projects and tasks. Flame propagation refers to how ideas and work spread through your team, ensuring everyone stays aligned. Heat management controls the intensity of activities to prevent burnout and maintain sustainable productivity.
